Special thanks to Drs. Kathy Nightingale and Ned Rouze, and Yufeng Deng, for
their efforts characterizing the CIRS Phase II phantoms and providing the
viscoelastic analysis of these samples.  Special thanks to Bo Qiang for leading
the ABAQUS simulations and providing the thorough analysis with LS-DYNA data
for the elastic simulations, and Jonathan Langdon for development of the
open-source, GPU-accelerated shear wave simulation code.  In addition to the
QIBA funding for this project, this work was also supported by contracts HHSN
