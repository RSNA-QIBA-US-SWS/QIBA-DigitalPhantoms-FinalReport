\section{Viscoelastic Material Analysis Metrics}\label{sect:ve_analysis}

The System Dependency and Phantoms Task Force identified that ``simple'',
analytic viscoelastic material models, such as Voigt and Maxwell materials,
inadequately capture the phase velocity trends measured across the energetic
frequency ranges associate with liver shear wave speed characterization [CITE].
Instead of using an analytic VE material model, we proposed characterizing the
phantoms using a linear dispersion model of the form

\begin{equation}
c(f) = c_0 + \frac{dc}{df} f.
\end{equation}

This linear model was fit to the 2D Fourier transform of axial velocity data
over a frequency range of 100--400 Hz, and two metrics were used to
characterize the viscoelasticity of materials:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Phase velocity at 200 Hz ($c_{200}$), and
    \item Line phase velocity slope from 100--400 Hz ($\frac{dc}{df}$).
\end{enumerate}

This model was applied to human data in patients with liver
fibrosis~\cite{Palmeri2011} (Figure~\ref{fig:phantom_liver_scatter_plot}) to
establish a range of realistic linear dispersion VE material values for healthy
through advanced fibrosis liver health.  The 2D Fourier transform data were
processed used the methods describe in~\cite{Nightingale2015}.
