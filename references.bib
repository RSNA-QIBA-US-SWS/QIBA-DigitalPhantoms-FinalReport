          form of chronic liver disease in developed countries, may progress to
              nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a minority of people.
              Those with NASH are at increased risk for cirrhosis and
              hepatocellular carcinoma.  The potential risk and economic burden
              of utilizing liver biopsy to stage NAFLD in an overwhelmingly
              large at-risk population are enormous; thus, the discovery of
              sensitive, inexpensive, and reliable noninvasive diagnostic
              modalities is essential for population-based screening.},
