\section{Future Work}\label{sect:future_work}

We have met all of our Round IV objectives, and we plan to extend our digital
phantom and viscoelastic phantom characterization efforts in Round V as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform statistical analysis on the Phase II measurment data and
    compare with simulated viscoelastic analyses.
    \item Expand the acoustic radiation force focal configurations to general
    shear waves with different spectral distributions of energy.
    \item Augment the existing visoelastic digital phantoms to have simulated
    raw RF / IQ data for displacement estimation.
    \item Evaluate the impact of attenuation and phase aberration effects on
    acoustic radiation force source distribution on the reconstructed shear
    wave speed.
\end{enumerate}

More details are available in the Round V proposal that was submitted earlier in the year.
