\section{Digital Phantoms}\label{sect:digital_phantoms}

\subsection{Elastic Materials}
The first-phase of digital phantoms focused on ``simple'' elastic material
formulations with different focal configurations and stiffnesses to evaluate
shear wave speed reconstruction accuracy and precision without viscosity as a
confounding variable.

A nominal curvilinear array configuration was chosen for all of the simulations
(Table~\ref{table:curvilinear}).

\begin{table}[htb!]
    \centering
    \caption{Simulated Curvilinear Array Configuration}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Radius of Curvature & 60 mm \\
    Element Height & 14 mm \\
    Element Pitch & 0.477 mm (0.007 mm kerf) \\
    Center Frequency & 3.0 MHz \\
    Fractional Bandwidth & 100\% \\
    Elevation Focus & 50 mm \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\label{table:curvilinear}
\end{table}

The acoustic radiation force excitation was simulated with several focal configurations (Table~\ref{table:arf}).

\begin{table}[htb!]
    \centering
    \caption{Acoustic Radiation Force Focal Configurations}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Frequency & 3.0 MHz \\
    F/\# & [2 ,3.5] \\
    Excitation Durations & [500, 1000] cycles \\
    Focal Depths & [30, 50 70] mm \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\label{table:arf}
\end{table}

Field II~\cite{Jensen1992} was used to simulate the acoustic intensity
associated with the different acoustic radiation force transmit conditions.
The material was acoustically modeled as linear with a constant acoustic
attenuation of 0.45 dB/(cm $\cdot$ MHz).  The acoustic intensity was mapped at
locations in the finite element meshes and the radiation force was either
applied as a point load~\cite{Palmeri2005} at each nodal location or a body
force across elements.

Different elastic material properties were simulated for each of the different
acoustic radiation force focal configurations (Table~\ref{table:elastic}).

\begin{table}[htb!]
    \centering
    \caption{Elastic Material Properties}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Poisson's Ratio & 0.495 \\
    Young's Moduli &  [1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0] kPa \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\label{table:elastic}
\end{table}

The finite mesh boundaries were either simulated having perfect matching layers
or infinite elements to reduce artifacts associated with compression and
shear wave reflections back into the regions of interest.  Different mesh densities were also studied to evaluate numerical accuracy; ultimately a uniform node spacing of 0.167 mm was used for the digital phantoms.

All of the model configuration scripts for LS-DYNA and ABAQUS have been uploaded to GitHub:

All of the digital phantom data has been saved in Matlab format and uploaded as
a single archive to QIDW:
